This package duplicates some of the HBase APIs to make it easier to work with the transaction APIs.
They are merely a utility, i.e., they are not required for using the transaction manager.
The main reasons they exist are the following:
<ol>
<li>Explicitly remove the timestamp from the APIs --> troup uses timestamps to implement MVCC
<li>Convert Deletes into Put + delete flag --> troup handles deletion of versions when they are no longer needed 
<li>Restrict the APIs to the ones we have tested
</ol>
